# TODO

[] Implement pager and cursor to manage the disk-based operations
    
[] SQL query parser is mid, how robust should i make it?
    - [] end with semicolon(;)
    - [] replace literal scans for a better approach
        e.g. delete from %s where id = %d, is bad.


[] Add tests for the database and tables

- LOG_ERROR: It should be used one level above implementation
