A **Mini Database System** project in C would be a great choice, as it will give you deep insight into key data structures and how they can be applied in real-world applications.

Here's how you could approach it:

### 1. **Data Storage**  
   - **Data Tables**: Use arrays or linked lists to represent tables. Each row in a table can be a node in a linked list, and each field in a row can be a structure.
   - **Serialization**: For storage, you can serialize the data to a file (binary or text) and deserialize it when loading, which will expose you to file I/O and memory management.

### 2. **Indexing**  
   - **Hash Tables**: Use hash tables to create indexes on fields to allow fast lookups. For example, if you have a `user` table, you could index the `username` field using a hash table to speed up lookups.
   - **B-Tree (Optional)**: If you want to implement more sophisticated indexing, you could add a B-tree for multi-field indexing, allowing faster searches and sorted queries.

### 3. **Query Processing**  
   - Implement a basic query parser that accepts simple SQL-like commands (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`).
   - **SELECT**: Implement simple SELECT queries to fetch data from tables based on a condition. Use your hash tables or trees to filter data efficiently.
   - **INSERT**: Add data to tables using linked lists or arrays.
   - **DELETE**: Remove data by searching for matching rows and unlinking or shifting elements.
   - **UPDATE**: Update existing records in tables by searching and modifying specific fields.

### 4. **Basic Optimizations**
   - **Caching**: Implement a simple cache to store frequently accessed rows or query results.
   - **Join Operations**: Implement basic join operations (e.g., inner join), which will help you understand how data is retrieved and combined from different tables.

### 5. **Data Integrity & Constraints**
   - Implement basic data integrity rules, like primary keys (ensure uniqueness) and foreign keys (ensure referential integrity).

### 6. **Query Language**
   - Design a very basic parser for a limited subset of SQL-like syntax. For example, just handle `SELECT` with `WHERE` conditions and `INSERT INTO` queries.
   - Use a simple tokenizer to break down the queries and a parser to handle the logic.

### 7. **Optimization Considerations**  
   - **Indexing**: Depending on query patterns, the performance might be significantly impacted by indexing strategies.
   - **Memory Management**: Pay attention to memory management, especially when inserting, updating, or deleting rows.

### Key Data Structures Involved:
- **Arrays**: For storing simple tables or data records.
- **Linked Lists**: For dynamic table row storage and easy insertion/deletion.
- **Hash Tables**: For indexing and fast lookups.
- **Trees**: For implementing more efficient multi-field indexes (optional).
- **Stacks/Queues**: For query parsing and tokenization.

This project is a great way to apply and reinforce knowledge of hashmaps, trees, arrays, and linked lists, and it simulates the core aspects of how relational databases manage data.
